      About
    </h2>
    <p class="about__text">
        Welcome friend. A bit about myself...<br><br>
        I was born and raised in southeast Michigan. The daughter of an artist and a computer programmer. My journey with computers began before I could talk, sitting in my highchair. In the 1st grade, my dad taught me Fox Pro. I took notes in my Lisa Frank notebook. I went on to study the completely unrelated field of Biology at the University of Michigan (Go Blue!). Post graduation, I fell into environmental compliance and safety. My husband‘s career eventually brought us to coastal Texas.<br><br>
        
        My wanderlust and desire for a more portable career lead me back to my original love for computers - coding & design.<br><br>
        
        And that is where I am now.
